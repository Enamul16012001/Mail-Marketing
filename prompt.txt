In this folder I want to create a project. This project is mainly for a company';s customer care agents who need to reply many mail. Replying thousand of mail in a day is very tough, that's why I want to make a project where using AI agent the mail reply can be done automatically. See there has a py file in this folder to send a mail to a specific mail id, still there has no AI involved. So this using this project, AI can reply to any email automatically. The AI agent can read user's mail, user's attached document and based on those AI (gemini) can generate reply. I am telling you some different reply case for it-
1. If user question is very generic, like thank you or this type of generic mail, the AI should reply it instantly as it is not required any knowledge about company or any verification from company employee.
2. If user's question is about company's information like any FAQ, about any product or policy, AI can reply it by company's rag database. In this case by rag AI agent can easily find the answer of user's question.
3. Some question is very critical, like any complain or something which required a company's employee to answer. So those mail should be pending and show it in frontend to reply it by employee.
4. Some mail may be possible to reply by AI but need further verification by company, this case AI will create a draft and save the mail as draft to confirm by company.
To implement RAG pipeline there should be a knowledge base folder where company can upload pdf, docx, txt or any other document from frontend to add those on knowledge base. Any knowledge base file may be deleted, thos pdf’s chunks in rag base should also deleted.
All gmail api related code you will find in https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides
So can you make the project? There should be a professional but simple frontend webpage which should easily used by user. Also all the code should be simple, don't make the code too complex
